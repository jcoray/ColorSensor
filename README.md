# ColorSensor
Arduino Library for reading color sensors made from photocells and RGB LEDs. 
Created by Jakob Coray with help from Gabriel.

## Usage
This library was designed as part of a project to build a robot that can solve a rubix cube. It is a dependency for the Cube.h library. 

## Installation 
Download the library, unzip it, and place it in the libraries folder. Detailed instructions can be found at: http://arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries. 
If you want to use this in conjuction with the Cube.h library (tested on IDE versions 1.1, 1.5.8, and 1.6.1. 1.6.2 has improves library integration, it may or may not work.), you will have to put it in the libraries folder in the Arduino source folder. On Linux the delfault location is /usr/share/arduino/libraries. 

You will also need the Bounce2 library. It can be found at: https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2.
